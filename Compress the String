Compress the String
Send Feedback
Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.
Exmple:
If a String has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.
Note :
Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than equal to 9.


Input Format :
The first and the only line of input contains a string(no spaces in between).
Output Format :
The only line of output print the compressed string.
 Note:
Return the compressed string and hence, no need to print.
Constraints :
0 <= |S| <= 10^7
Where |S| represents the length of string, S.

Time Limit: 1sec
